  <p>However that may be, philosophic thought or “scientific” thought in the 
Hegelian sense of the word — i.e., rigorously true thought — has the goal of 
revealing, through the meaning of a coherent discourse (<em>Logos</em>)<em>, Being 
</em>(<em>Sein</em>) as it <em>is and exists </em>in the totality of its 
objective-Reality (<em>Wirklichkeit</em>). The philosophic or “scientific” 
<em>Method, </em>therefore, must assure the adequation of Thought to Being, since 
Thought must adapt itself to Being and to the Real without modifying them in any 
way whatsoever. This is to say that the attitude of the philosopher or the 
"scientist” (= the Wise Man) with respect to Being and to the Real is one of 
purely passive <em>contemplation, </em>and that philosophic or “scientific” 
activity reduces to a pure and simple <em>description </em>of the Real and of 
Being. The Hegelian <em>method, </em>therefore, is not at all “dialectical": it is 
purely contemplative and descriptive, or better, <em>phenomenological </em>in 
Husserl’s sense of the term. In the Preface and the Introduction to the 
<em>Phenomenology, </em>Hegel insists at length on the passive, contemplative, and 
descriptive character of the “scientific” method. He underlines that there is a 
dialectic of “scientific” thought only because there is a dialectic of the Being 
which that thought reveals. As soon as the revealing description is correct, it 
can be said that <em>ordo et connexio idearum idem est</em> <em>ac ordo et connexio 
rerum</em>; for the order and the connection of the real are, according to Hegel, 
dialectical.</p>
